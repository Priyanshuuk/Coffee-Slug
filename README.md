# Coffee-Slug

Coffee Slug is a mobile app that helps you discover local coffee shops around you based on real-time distance. Whether you're exploring a new city or just looking for your next caffeine fix, Coffee Slug shows nearby cafés, gives directions, and even lets you track the places you've visited — like a personal coffee journal (I call it your "Coffee Git").

For shop owners, it's an easy way to put your café on the map and bring in new customers.

Whether you're a coffee lover or a café owner, Coffee Slug connects people to good coffee — one slug at a time.
